This is a bot to play the abstract strategy game of "Barca" via the Flash
interface on http://playbarca.com/?page_id=250.

This program is based on a bot I wrote a few years ago to get high scores
in the single-player Flash game "Jorinapeka". I've rewritten major chunks
of it to do an alpha-beta search of the game space for the two-player
Flash game "Barca" (playbarca.com/?page_id=250).
    
This program will work only on a system with BOTH of the following
programs installed and on your path:
    
    (1) xdotool, for generating clicks programmatically
    
    (2) Either ImageMagick "import" (Linux) or
        Apple "screencapture" (OS X)
    
Also, you'll need libpng (sudo apt-get libpng-dev) in order to
compile it. Since both libpng and xdotool are hard-to-impossible
to install on OS X, I'm developing on Ubuntu Linux (11.10, 64-bit).

To run the bot, open a browser window to playbarca.com/?page_id=250
(you'll need Flash installed), and then launch "barca" in a separate
terminal window. "barca" will use ImageMagick to screenshot the Flash
game to a PNG file in /tmp; read in that PNG file and compute the
proper move; and then use xdotool to generate the appropriate click
events. It will do this in a loop every second or two until somebody
wins the game or you kill it.

You can use this to play against the playbarca.com AI, or (this is
not implemented yet) to play against yourself by changing the black
player from "robot" to "human" control.
