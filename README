This is a bot to play the abstract strategy game of "Barca" via the Flash
interface on http://playbarca.com/?page_id=250.

This program is based on a bot I wrote a few years ago to get high scores
in the single-player Flash game "Jorinapeka". I've rewritten major chunks
of it to do an alpha-beta search of the game space for the two-player
Flash game "Barca" (playbarca.com/?page_id=250).

This program will work only on a system with BOTH of the following
programs installed and on your path:

    (1) Either "xdotool" (Linux) or
        Carsten Bl√ºm's "cliclick" (OS X)

    (2) Either ImageMagick "import" (Linux) or
        Apple's built-in "screencapture" (OS X)

Also, you'll need libpng:

    (3) Either "sudo apt-get libpng-dev" (Linux) or
        download and install XQuartz (OS X)

I've tested this on 64-bit Ubuntu 11.10 and 64-bit OS X 10.8.2.
If you're deciding between the two of them, note that it's much easier
to "sudo apt-get install xdotool imagemagick libpng-dev" on Ubuntu
than to download and run the installers for all the OS X stuff!

To run the bot, open a browser window to playbarca.com/?page_id=250
(you'll need Flash installed), and then launch "barca --white" in a
separate terminal window. "barca" will use ImageMagick to screenshot
the Flash game to a PNG file in /tmp; read in that PNG file and compute
the proper move; and then use xdotool to generate the appropriate click
events. It will do this in a loop every second or two, clicking
automatically to reset the board upon winning, until you kill it
with Ctrl+C.

You can use this to play against the playbarca.com AI, or to play
against yourself by changing the Flash game's black player from
"robot" to "human" and running this with "barca --black".

You can also play this AI against itself (which will probably go on
forever with no winner) by running "barca --black --white".
